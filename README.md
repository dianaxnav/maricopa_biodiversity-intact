# Maricopa Biodiversity Analysis (2017 & 2020)
Purpose

Maricopa County has had the most urban development since 2001. The issue with urban development is that it can cause pressures on the natural environment and biodiversity in the area. This analysis demonstrates the loss of biodiversity through the BII(biodiversity intactness index) from 2017 to 2020.
